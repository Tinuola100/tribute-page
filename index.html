        I will dearly miss Steve Jobs, he inspired me to keep getting the iPhone<br>
         i<br> have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man and a<br>
          awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day and go for and<br>
           work with the apple. When i got old
        but my dream is to own Apple and follow<br>
        by steve Jobs way and make Apple greater than before it was. But i will<br>
     dearly miss Steve Jobs he's a great man and i will never forget him.

        <strong>so sad</strong><br><br>
        As i heard this sad news via my iphone i am emailing my condolences from <br>
        my Macbook pro. Steve has left a fingerprint on our culture that cannot be<br>
        rivaled and will be long lasting. My deepest sympathy to his family and<br>
        friends.

        <strong>Steve Jobs</strong><br><br>
        What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story i've written<br>
        as an adult(and certainly every one that has been published), almost every<br>
        email i've ever written, has been written on machines created by Apple.
        I<br> interacted online using an Apple machine long before i ever encountered a<br>
        PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star trek future i dreamed as a kid.<br>
        And through his vision, i have been able to realize my own. You'll be<br>
        missed, Mr Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.

        <strong>He's gone</strong><br><br>
        A part of my heart is cracked. I didnt know him personally but i felt like i<br>
        knew him. I will forever remember him
        . I'm still saddened because he was<br> taken too soon. I can only imagine his struggles. Heaven has
        certainly<br>
        gained an angel.

        <strong>Condolences</strong><br><br>
        Dear Apple i was deeply saddened to hear about the death of Steve Jobs,<br>
        the great leader and creator in the world. I believe he would go to a more<br>
        beatiful place and he would like to see a stronger Apple. We will remember<br>
         him forever

        <strong>thank you</strong><br><br>
        Never got a chance to thank you for every thing you have done for all of us.<br>
        Your thoughts are an inspiration and your legacy shall be followed. Now is <br>
        time for you to rest in peace.

        <strong>I will always remember Steve!</strong><br><br>
        Dear Steve's family, dear Apple company i can't find words how to describe<br>
        my feelings..For me Apple means a lot - I got a good job using Apple<br>
        products. I have found a new lifestyle thanks to Apple. And, of course, i've <br>
        been always admiring your products. And for me everything in Apple is connected<br>
        with steve. I do hope he'll be remembered around the world as a genius.
